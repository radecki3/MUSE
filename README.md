This work was done with the oversight of Dr. Tony Wong at UIUC, who was my research advisor and directed much of my work shown here. Dr. Wong made many contributions to the code, some of which are unseen in this repo. 

This repository contains several notebooks for processing ESO MUSE data. All MUSE data that was used is courtsey of NSF, ESO, and Dr. Anna McLeod at Durham University. Dr. Peter Zeidler at STScI created the MUSEpack Python package and assisted with our correction efforts.

We also made use of NSF NOIRLab's DEMCELS data and GAIA DR3 data, which are both publicly acessible.
